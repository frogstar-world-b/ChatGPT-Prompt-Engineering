    "It is a parameter between 0 and 1, and it references the degree of randomness of the model. The model chooses its next word according to a distribution over all words. Lower temperature keeps this distribution unchanged, but higher temperature would start favoring words with a lower probability. Thus, the model diverges from the original distribution as the temperature parameter increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Set `temperature=0` if you want a more robust and predictable output. At higher temperatures, the assistant is more creative / distractable! Feel free to try a variety of temperature values."
