    "## Principles of Prompt Engineering\n",
    "### I. Write clear and specific instructions\n",
    "- **Tactic 1**: Use delimeters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input. Those also help avoid prompt injections (a user's direct input to the prompt). \n",
    "    - Triple quotes: \"\"\"\n",
    "    - Triple brackticks: ```\n",
    "    - Triple dashes: ---\n",
    "    - Angle brackets: < >,\n",
    "    - XML tags: ```<tag> </tag>```\n",
    "- **Tactic 2**: Ask for structured ouput (e.g., json or HTML)\n",
    "- **Tactic 3**: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied. Check assumptins required to do the task; if not tell the model how to handle this. Also, how should the model handle edge cases?\n",
    "- **Tactic 4**: Few shot prompting: Give examples of successful completing of the tasks. Then ask the model to perform the task.\n",
    "### II. Give the model time to \"think\"\n",
    "The model can make reasoning errors by rushing to an incorrect conculsion. You can encourage the model to spend more time (more computational resources) on the task. Sometimes we get better results when we explicitly instruct the model to reason from first principles before coming to a conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Limitations\n",
    "- Hallucinations: The model makes up statements that sound plausible but are not true.\n",
    "- To reduce hallucinations ask the model to first find relevant information, then to answer conditional on this information. "
